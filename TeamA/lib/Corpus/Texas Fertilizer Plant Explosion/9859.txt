I'm so used to walking or taking public transport to nearby places but those don't seem like options here. Cities have a very different atmosphere as a result - it makes places like Dallas seem less crowded than Sydney, but less lively somehow.
People are friendly and make conversation with strangers. Usually a nice thing, except for when someone working in a store is trying to solicit me and I just want to browse.
Huge meal sizes, free refills, cheap food... I'm going to be so fat by the time I leave this place.
"Y'all" is such a cute word. Y'all.
EDIT: Thanks for the gold!

When I was  young and naive, I  learned from online forums that Americans took shits that clogged their toilets. I assumed that Americans take massive shits that we Europeans just can't match (after all, everything is bigger in America)
When I came to US, I learned that they just have different toilets with small hole that gets clogged. European toilets never do that. They have bigger hole. You can put tennis ball trough it.

The kind where you put a couple of quarters in, open the drawer and take out one newspaper. 
Everyone always says "Where I come from, they'd take all the newspapers!" What you are going to do with more than one copy of the day's paper is beyond me. 
EDIT: TIL Redditors have a lot of opinions about newspapers.

One time I was in California on vacation, and literally within 15 minutes of using my card for the first time there I got a call concerning the charge and confirming that it was me.  If I hadn't picked up or if it wasn't, they would have cancelled the card and mailed me a new one with 1 day shipping.  So basically steal it all you want, it isn't an inconvenience to me at all.

But the one thing I hate is the placement of commercials on TV. It might be only for certain channels, but for a 30-minute show, there will be about 4 commercial breaks. And not even evenly spaced. Including one before the credits at the end of a show. Then it'll jump straight from the credits to the next show.

There's a 1-2 min teaser introducing the premise of the episode, then the title sequence, then a commercial break.
Act I: 6-7 min, then 2-3min commercial break.
Act II: 6-7 min, then 2-3min commercial break.
Act III: 6-7 min, then 2-3min commercial break.
Then Comedies will usually end with a 1-2 min skit/callback joke involving the B plot, and Dramas will go straight to the credits.  TV is all about structure.

While browsing the shelves, I found some hot dogs.  They were marked with a great big starburst label "American style!" Only they completely weren't.  These were frankfurter style and encased in a jar filled with opaque liquid. 110% not how it's done in the US.  A month later, back in the States, I found the same brand of hot dogs, only in the States they were marked "German style." Get it together, hot dogs.

That took a long time for me to grasp, because in a lot of european cities, (particularly in Stockholm where I'm from) it's the other way around. 
Sure, there are lots of nice suburbs with expensive villas and stuff here, but living in the city centre is almost always more expensive and more "high brow" or what you'd call it.
Edit: I was perhaps generalizing a bit too much, and there are lots of variations in the US, but it was still a phenomenon that I remember being struck by when I realized it.

It's completely sealed off so I don't know what arcane energies power it.  But you push that lever down an pampf WHOOOOOGGGGBBLL, jet like a motherfucking firehose.  In two and a half years cleaning toilets I have never ever had to plunge at the urologist.  It's even better than those commercial ones without tanks.  If I ever buy a house, first thing I'm doing is calling that urologist and finding out what black rituals power their toilets.

They're scrutinized and have fans and do TV interviews, and it just boggles my mind so much. They're just students that do an extra-curricular activity! I don't understand.
Edit: Since people seem to still be finding this comment, I have another question: Are high school students as passionate and involved in their extra-curricular activities as TV shows/movies make out? Not just football, but also things like drama, cheerleading, newspaper/year book etc? We had barely any extra-curriculars at my school, and the ones we did have were just things to do to pass the time basically. I think most Australian high school and unis are like this.
Edit 2: I'm being told so many conflicting things about high school extra-curricular activities. I guess it varies.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all you responses everyone! I did read them all, just couldn't arsed replying to most of them. Just to clear up a few things for you guys: I'm from Australia. A lot of you are asking 'well how do you make friends/meet someone new if you don't talk to strangers?' Just in my opinion of what I see, it's more like you need to go out there and try new things, join clubs, meet friends of friends etc to meet new people rather than talking to someone on the street. But I think on the whole, we are a bit more reserved than Americans. I think people also need to realise that I am just one person, and this is how I see things. Other Australians might feel the complete opposite to me, and a lot of you have said completely contradictory things to each other as well, we're all individuals! Thanks for all of your input, it was really interesting to read!

Everything is very far away. Big country, I guess.
Americans are very loud, laugh a lot and can also be a bit touchy-feely. Not that this is bad; when I was in the US, everyone was very friendly and I had a great time. But they're always laughing and shouting and going "Oh my god", it's like everything is super exciting for them. The bit that was kind of strange was that they'd often touch my arms or shoulders or hair, or gesture towards me. That's something that's generally a bit intimate and intrusive in England. Again, everyone was friendly so I'm not saying this to be mean, but it does take some getting used to, because it's a bit in-your-face at first.
Weird as hell ice cream flavours. I bought "dinosaur eggs"-flavour that was blue with chocolate eggs in in a regular supermarket. Is this an American thing, or a strange-town-I-visited thing?
Motorised mobility wheelchairs in supermarkets. I've only ever seen maybe 1 or 2 emergency-only selfies in Tesco, but in the US, they had a lot of these and you could walk right up and take them if you wanted to. It seems strange, that someone who needs a motorised wheelchair wouldn't have their own, but I think this could be a knock-on effect of expensive healthcare, maybe...?
Jaywalking is a crime? I did this a lot in the US without realising it was supposed to be illegal (albeit one of those crimes no one really ever gets caught for). Oops. Sorry, guys!
Flags all over the place. Flags are a little more common in England since the Olympics and royal wedding though.
Bread is sweet and chocolate isn't? Pancakes for breakfast was weird too, but there was an IHOP right next to our hotel and that was pretty great. I kinda miss it.
Waiters that are really, REALLY pushy about special offers. OK, you already told me I get free chips if I get a Large burger, but I didn't even want a burger. No, please don't tell me about all the extras and sides I could get for the burger as well. I DON'T WANT IT.
Sarcasm and self-depreciating humour is not as well-recieved. As someone who uses a lot of self-depreciating humour, Americans were always trying to comfort me after I made a joke about myself. In England, people tended just laugh or join in by making a similar joke about themselves. It was rather sweet though.
Toilets with giant door gaps. Why, why, why?
Terraced and semi-detached buildings are not very common at all, and streets are really wide. I suppose because most of American buildings were built relatively recently, whereas a lot of Britain was built up before cars were around, so we often have smaller streets and compact houses. 
I'm a big lover of documentaries, but I could not watch them in the US. There is lots and lots and lots and LOTS of talking, cartoon sound effects, and loud music. You could be watching a lion lazily looking at a gazelle miles away and it's blaring music that sounds like an action film finale, whilst the narrator talks about lions for twelve paragraphs using all sorts of weird, casual expressions, and every time the gazelle moves it plays a loud "BWOOOIING" sound effect. Well, that was an exeggeration, but do you get what I mean? It felt like - and I don't know how true this is - that documentaries in the US are treated like educational shows for reluctant children whose parents made them watch it, rather than proper a series an adult might watch out of genuine interest. 
This sounds so patronising and I'm really sorry if it is but... we went to a lot of theme parks and it always entertained us how Americans say "vehicle".

Not a difference but also pretty funny: Americans seem to underestimate what foreigners know about the US. I know you say "eggplant", "cilantro", "restroom" and "truck" instead of "aubergine", "coriander", "loo" and "lorry". We get tonnes of films and TV programmes and books from the US, probably more than you get from Britain, so we have heard these terms before! Again, though, I do appreciate their consideration, but it's still a bit funny how they act as if you're learning a whole new language being there.
Another apology for if this sounded patronising or mean-spirited. People from the US were all very lovely people when I went there, I had a wonderful time, and I mean no offence.

Went to this sport shop to buy goggles. In Texas. At one end of the store the biggest collections of rifles, guns, machetes and army gadget I've ever seen. So I decide to snap a picture to send home and the shop assistant comes and say "Sir, I'm so sorry" "Oh, I can't take a picture?" "No, go ahead, I'm sorry we don't have ammos anymore". (It was a couple of weeks after the school shooting - Sandy Hook).
When I then told this to my Texan friends I realised all of them (even at the wedding I was invited to) had at least one gun, if not several. When they told me it was for self-defense and I told them we don't have that many guns in Europe they asked me what would I do to defend myself and they laughed their ass of when I replied "well, I run!"
EDIT: gosh, so many replies, I didn't see that coming! I wanted to add that Texas was lovely and the people fantastic. It was such a contrast to notice how someone with a gun always sticking out of the jacket could be so lovely and charming. The average Texan was like a mix between Rambo and Santa Claus, lovely but deadly at the same time, which was a surprise as someone armed in here would be a thug. But as someone mentioned people in the US are much more friendly than the stereotype and it's always lovely to go back. 
Also I remember chatting with this girl in Dallas. She is in line in front of me in a coffee shop and asks me where I am from since I was talking to a friend and she picked up the weird accent. She sits with us and I ask her "does a young good looking girl like you own a gun too" and she replies "I have 4 shotguns!" (I anyway proceeded to invite her out, a good looking it Italian shirt can be a true killer)

Unfortunately bullets were sold out after Sandy Hook and we couldn't go, they were adamant in not using their reserve stash. But I would have loved to try, I have never even hold a gun, but I imagine being fun in the proper context.
EDIT: after reading the comments I'm surprised, I though you could have a couple of guns and say 100 rounds, just in case the whole mafia would visit your house. Thousands... They told me each bullet was a dollar and that it was very difficult to go in those particular days. Thanks Obama! But we went to the rodeo and to see NBA, so I will do some trigger happy shooting like It's always sunny in Philadelphia next time.

They seem to see kids (i was maybe 13-14) always as troublemakers. For example, i rode my bike through some tiny village in the Rockies and just rested on a bench. I sat there and watched stuff cause everything was new for me. 10 minutes later the police showed up and asked why i'm here, what i'm doing etc. They were not nice and i didn't understand what i'm doing wrong. The only time a police officer stopped me in Germany as a kid was when he asked me if i could spare some of my crisps...
Edit: I didn´t expect that much responses. I didn´t want to bash the US. Just answered op´s question. And sorry for the "crisps" We (Germany) also call it Chips, but  i googled it to be safe and...well, Linguee said Crisps.

Also, some areas tax different items differently. For example, if I go to the grocery 1 mile west of me, it's 7% sales tax. If I go 1 mile east, it's 0% sales tax because that county doesn't allow taxing grocery. When I lived in Columbus, OH they didn't tax grocery there either, and any kind of takeout food was considered a grocery item. Where I live now, there is an additional tax on takeout / fast food items. Don't even get me started on online taxation!

Herpes drug? A couple laughing on a pier and going canoeing. 
Antidepressants? Woman walking through a field of flowers in a flowing dress.

Edit: Okay. It seems that everyone is reminding me about the Cialis commercial with a couple sitting outside in bathtubs drinking wine. That one is its own brand of strange.
