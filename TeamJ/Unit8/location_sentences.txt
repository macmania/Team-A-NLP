will connecticut school shooting spur gun control action?
police: 20 children among 26 victims of connecticut school shootingcut school shooting tragedy
 (ap) â€” investigators on saturday worked to understand what led a bright but painfully awkward 20-year-old to slaughter 26 children and adults at a connecticut elementary school, while townspeople took down christmas decorations and struggled with how to get through a holiday season that has suddenly become a time of mourning
the mystery deepened as newtown education officials said they had found no link between lanza's mother and the school, contrary to news reports that said she was a teacher there
the tragedy plunged newtown into mourning and added the picturesque new england community of handsome colonial homes, red-brick sidewalks and 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change
 among them: well-liked principal dawn hochsprung, who town officials say tried to stop the rampage and paid with her life; the school psychologist who probably would have helped survivors grapple with the tragedy; a teacher thrilled to have been hired this year; and a 6-year-old girl who had just moved to newtown from canada

helping children cope with connecticut shootingo school, police say
a connecticut community is working together to discover what happened after a gunman entered an elementary school and shot dead 20 children and six adults before apparently killing himself
 a shooting involving two gunmen erupted at a connecticut elementary school this morning, prompting the town of newtown to lock down all of its schools and draw swat teams to the school, authorities said today
 initial 911 calls stated that multiple students were trapped in a classroom, possibly with a gunman, according to a connecticut state police source

 (ap) â€” the gunman behind the connecticut elementary school massacre stormed into the building and shot 20 children at least twice with a high-powered rifle, executing some at close range and killing adults who tried to stop the carnage, authorities said saturday
 they included ana marquez-greene, a little girl who had just moved to newtown from canada; victoria soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal dawn hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him and paid with her life
the tragedy has plunged newtown into mourning and added the picturesque new england community of handsome colonial homes, red-brick sidewalks and 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change
 president barack obama planned to visit newtown on sunday
 "we reach out to the community of newtown and express our heartfelt sorrow for this incomprehensible and profound loss of innocence," the family said in a statement
	teacher victoria soto used her body to shield her students from the maniacal gunman who launched a massacre at a connecticut school, relatives said saturday

		agents visit connecticut gun shops after school massacree able to make sense of a day in which a 20-year-old man goes into an elementary school in connecticut and kills 26 people Â— 20 of them 
because i grew up in newtown
like many of my classmates, i couldnâ€™t wait to leave newtown once i turned eighteen
 and although i did exactly that, over the years i have come to love newtown from three thousand miles away
but newtown is far from perfectâ€”part norman rockwell and partÂ roseanne, full of muscle cars and soccer fields, metalheads and vineyard vines, ridiculous columnar mansions looming over ramshackle lots
 nevertheless, newtown is an honest and genuinely beautiful place
newtown will eventually recover, without ever quite being the same

learn how to help the victims and families affected by the connecticut school shooting tragedy
  all newtown schools were placed in lockdown after the shooting, the newtown public school district said
â€  danbury hospital, about 11 miles (18 km) west of the school, had received three patients from the scene, a hospital spokeswoman told nbc connecticut
but unlike the virginia tech rampage, during which 33 people including the gunman died, the connecticut shootings were at an elementary school where pupils ranged from kindergarten to fourth grade
 among them: well-liked principal dawn hochsprung, who town officials say tried to stop the rampage and paid with her life; the school psychologist who probably would have helped survivors grapple with the tragedy; a teacher thrilled to have been hired this year; and a 6-year-old girl who had just moved to newtown from canada
"the immediate concern we have is for those families in newtown whose lives are now altered, forever," joe samaha, the foundation's president said
