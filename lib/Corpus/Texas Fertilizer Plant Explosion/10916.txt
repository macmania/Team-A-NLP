The Rules
A) Respect and tolerance. No hate material, be it links or comments, are acceptable. All controversial or possibly insensitive materials should include a thorough bibliography of sources. History is not found on a single blog - track down your sources before you make proclamations.  
B) When posting, find the most relevant source. Blogspam is not acceptable. Sometimes copy/pasting the first paragraph of an interesting blogspam post into Google will help you track down the original source.   Also, please check the front page of the subreddit to see if that topic has already be submitted and discussed recently. 
C) Responding to each other is a key part of discourse - do it with respect.  
D) If you are having a problem with this subreddit, write to the mods through modmail with a full description of the issue as well as relevant links (to problematic comments, bad links, etc). 
E) Spamming is always unacceptable.  
F) Downvote for irrelevancy, low content, or unhelpful content. Upvote for rich and interesting content.  
G) Images need to be submitted via self/text posts!
H) Need help with homework or an assignment?   We will remove anything deemed too blatant a request to do your work / research for you.  
I) No politics! Submissions that are overtly political will be removed; political topics are only acceptable if discussed in a historical context.. This is entirely at the moderators' discretion and violators will be fed to the bear.
All rules are subject to the discretion of the moderators.
